|[Deploying Angular and Node to the Cloud!](http://slides.com/johnpapa/vikings2018#/5)| Keynote |Your Angular app is complete! Now it's time to deploy it to the cloud. But how? One key ingredient is determining our goals. Do you want to publish directly from your laptop or through source control and CI/CD? Do you worry that it may work differently on your machine than the cloud? What about locking down versions of node, packages, and OS? Is your head about to explode? We'll explore several good options as we discuss the pros and cons of each including direct deployments, GitHub hooks with CI, and docker. We'll demonstrate how to code, debug, and run docker locally to have confidence that what works locally will work in the cloud. The good news is that tooling has improved to make all of these deployment options within your reach to guide you to successfully deploy your Angular app to the cloud. - [Video](https://youtu.be/XmpEZN5TCjw) | 100 |
| [THR3105 - Best practices for mission critical apps on Azure App Service](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/66630?source=sessions) | Session |Azure App Service provides 99.95% SLA even for apps running on only a single instance. However, there are steps you should take as a developer to insulate your customers from perceived cold start latencies incurred when deploying a new version of an app. This session walks through using a combination of multi-phase deployment slots (swap with preview), local cache for disk resiliency, application initialization for warmup, and proper app service plan configuration to minimize cold start performance hits. | 200 |
| [THR1110 - Your web apps from code to deployed in a minute!](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/66652?source=sessions#ignite-html-anchor) | Session | Web developers want to focus on code, not be held back by the pain of getting an app deployed to Azure App Service. In this session, learn how to use Azure CLI to deploy your code to App Service with a single command, regardless of your language. | 200 |
